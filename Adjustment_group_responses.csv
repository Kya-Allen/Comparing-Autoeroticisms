In order to feel present and secure, I need to feel like my body reflects my gender, and like I'm a sexual and desirable person. So to facilitate that, I devote some focus to the aspects of my body that feel gender-affirming, and to the signs of my own arousal. I need enough sense of my own hotness to feel confident that I'm hot to my partner, and to overcome a lingering sense of fear/shame from past trauma. However my body and self are never the primary focus of my sexual awareness, and I am never hot to myself in the way that other people can be hot to me. 

In my private sexual fantasies, I as my actual self am rarely even a character. I'm usually inhabiting a character, and that character could have any gender and could be cis or trans. In sexual fantasy and in my mind in general, I spend a lot of time imagining and exploring experiences other than my own. The point of partnered sex for me is to bond with my partner who I'm in love with.... the point of masturbation and erotic fantasy is to get outside the confines of my own life and to explore a fuller range of human sexual experiences. So that's why I answered affirmatively to at least one of the ""do you find it hot to imagine yourself as a sexy woman"" questions. It's not that I want to be or to see myself as a hot woman, or that I inherently find it hot to imagine myself as a woman... it's about experiencing distinctive dynamics and scenarios that I can't (and wouldn't want to) have in my own body and life."

As for a direct answer my own physical body has not turned me on, as far as imagining being teh opposite gender I have had PIV sex  on my back with my partner on top of me on her back, when I was rubbing her clitoris and fondling her breasts I did imagine that I was doing those things to myself… perhaps that experience will be helpful for your research."
