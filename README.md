# Comparing-Autoeroticisms
This is a repository for my never-completed study on Autogynephilia and Erotic Self-Focus in Women

# Data Description:

The data is split into two datasets, each corresponding to either the control group (Control_group_responses.csv), or the effect group (Adjustment_group_responses.csv). The effect in question is an adjustment to the wording of the items of the Anatomic subscale of the Generalized Autogynephilia Scale [citation]. Each subject was randonly assigned to either the control group or the effect group using a Google Apps Script which, upon clicking the link, would automatically use a random number generator to randomly render either the Google Form with the unadjusted items, or the Google Form with the adjusted items. 

The data is from an online convenience sample. The link to the Google Apps Script was shared on several sites such as Twitter, and Subreddits of various topics, tags on tumblr etc. A list of each exact platform/community where the link was posted, along with available details on the number of likes/impressions on the post will be made available in the additional materials. We did not ask respondents to specify where they found the survey, so we can't be sure where responses come from.

All subjects were required to indicate that they were 18 years or older, and that they consented to what was outlined in the Informed Consent Block.

# Measures:

Variable: (csv_column_label) (response type)

**Sex/Gender:** (sex_gender) (Multiple Choice)
Subjects were asked to select their sex/gender from a list of options, each specifying a gender identity and an indicator of assigned sex at birth. Additionally, subjects were allowed to select "other" and write in their own identity.

**Kinsey Scale:** (kinsey_scale) (7-Point Likert)
Subjects were asked to rate their sexual orientation from exclusively gynesexual to exclusively androsexual

**HRT:** (HRT) (binary response)
Subjects were asked whether or not they take cross-sex hormones for the purpose of gender/sex transition

**dimorphism:** (dimorphism) (7-point Likert)
Subjects were asked to rate their own subjective perception of their body as physically masculine or feminine

**sexual behavior:** (sexual_behavior) (Checklist)
Subjects were asked to specify what sex/gender (same list as Sex/Gender question) groups they have had sexual encounters with

**Erotic Self-Focus Questionnaire, Factor 1 - Arousal to Own Body/self:** (ESFQ_X; X = item number) (7-point Likert)
Subjets were administered a 20 question subscale of the Erotic Self-Focus Questionnaire reflecting the first factor of the full scale found by EFA (Evan Fertel, 2015).

**Generalized Autogynephilia Scale, Factor 1 - Anatomic Autogynephilia:** (AGP_X; X = item number) (5-point Likert)
Subjects were administered a 7 question subscale of the Generalized Autogynephilia scale, reflecting the first factor of the full scale found by EFA (Hsu Et al., 2015)

**Free Response:** (testimony) (qualitative, text)
Subjects were asked to describe how embodiment does or does not play a role in their sexuality

# Legend:

**Kinsey Scale:** 0 = gynesexual; 6 = androsexual; 3 = bisexual; missing data = Asexual

**dimorphism (self-rating of physical masculinity vs femininity):** 1 = highly masculine; 7 = highly feminine
